Hi, Iâ€™m Hilal Morrar. I am a senior undergraduate student at UC Santa Cruz studying Computer Science. 

I am interested in Machine Learning and Distributed/Operating Systems.

Currently working on a few various projects:
1. Applying to new graduate jobs and internships in Machine Learning and/or Systems, preferably research based.
2. The Unofficial UCSC Student Guide: A comprehensive guide about all aspects of being a student at UCSC.
